It was April 2016.That was my first time as an intern at a large and influential place. I learned many things including the mental and physical challenges. I learned how to cook at 7 type of kitchen in PWTC. I learned how to cook in a big portion per day. The chef really polished my cooking skills. They really friendly and kind. They gave me their trust to cook for them and we ate together like a family. They even brought me to taste others hotel new menu and discover more about the taste of food. I still remembered, when the chef allowed me to go with them at ISTANA NEGARA. I was like... WOWWWWWWWWWW for a real. I entered the Istana Negara as a part of PWTC's chefs. I even got 3 times to served at Najib's house. THIS IS REAL NOT A JOKE AT ALL ! I even got offered to be a part of them (chef) but I really need to continued my studies as a promise to my dad. Sorry for not showing the pictures, because I'd lost all of the pictures as a forgot to transfered all the pictures before I sold my old iphone. Sorry for the unconvincing situation.</dd> </li> </p> </ul>

	<dd> <ul> <li style="margin: 10px 170px 10px 100px"> <p> As you can see at your right, they are the sous chef and main chef for each of the kitchen. They are very kind and respectful. They always take care of me just like their own daughter. There are 7 different types of kitchen in PWTC such as Cold Kitchen,Butcher,Pastry Kitchen,Malay Kitchen,Chinese KItchen,Western Kitchen,Eastern Kitchen. These kitchen played major role in every single events that held in PWTC. From there, I've learned and gained many input and new skills. Until now, we still keep in touch.</dd> </li> </p> </ul>
