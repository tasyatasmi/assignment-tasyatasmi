<li style="margin: 1px 200px 1px 150px"> <b> <p>RIGHT:</b> He is my ITS lecturer for previous semester. He's known as Dr. Amri but I called him 'USTAZ' and he didn't mind at all. HAHA. Actually, it happened when I mispronounced his name and suddenly I called him 'USTAZ'. I still remember when I called him Ustaz, he laughed and said "you can called me ustaz if you want it too". Until now, I kept calling him Ustaz instead of Dr.Amri. This picture was taken when he said in our group whatsapp that he cancelled his class but suddenly he said he wanted to continue his class for that day. Ended up, there were Adilah and me only who attended his class on that day.#appreciatelecturer</p> </li>
